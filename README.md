# SocialNetworkGUI
This is a social network that was developed by Ibrahim Mansour and Yousef Helal for a Data Structures and Abstraction final. It makes use of numerous user-created data structures, including but not limited to: dictionaries, graphs, bags, lists, etc. It has numerous features, and makes use of the CRUD operations. It also has a feature that recommends friends to a profile, and does this by iterating over the friends of friend vertices in a Undirected Graph.

A GUI version demonstrates the many features of this application in a user-friendly environment. To run this version, run the "user-interface.java" file. To see pictures of the pre-defined, make sure to put them in the appropriate directory, and alter the path in the AddFriends Class. User-created pictures will work fine.
